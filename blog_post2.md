# Network+ Cert Update

So the last time I updated this blog I was feeling confident and in control.  
  
So what happened? I had a plan. I had structured out my studies, it was all 
laid down. Unfortunately, as I write this it's August 2020. We are in the 
middle of a global pandemic trying to deal with Covid19. My access to the 
course was timed, and I have not made enough progress to be granted an 
extension. This is far from the end of my studies, but I have to admit to 
myself that I didn't have the time or headspace to get the course done in the 
allotted time. This is an open acknowledgement that sometimes it doesn't go as 
planned.  
  
So what now? Well, I didn't come away empty handed. I've learned a lot about 
networks. I've found some very helpful resources, and I'll be sharing them soon
 in a separate post. For now, I take what I've learned, read more books, and 
attempt self paced, self directed study. I will get my Network+, and we can 
take it from there. In the meantime, I need to remember why this is fun again. 
To that end, I'm going to get back into hackthebox.eu and read technical papers
 because they're fun and interesting. Not just because they fit CompTIA 
 certification. I'll get that too...  
   
 But for now, _fun_.
